- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @gavinblanusa

Iâ€™m interested in data, statistics, economcs, machine learning, and math. I use my passion for numbers to fuel my drive and curiosity for data and 
statistics within the fields of Finance, Economics, Sports, Health and the Stock Market.

My current position is a data analyst for Cruiter.ai - an automated tech sourcing startup located in San Francisco. I will have worked there for 7 months now, I 
have learned a great deal in my data analysis and data manipulation skills. As Cruiter.ai is a startup, I get thrown on many different projects with other coworkers.
The founder and CEO has had me go to Tech events in San Francisco to learn and research about cutting edge tech in the startup space and apply my research to 
Cruiter.ai, this includes, RAG, AWS, ElasticSearch, AI, Snowflake, etc.

Iâ€™m currently building on my python skills through passion projects and reading the book Introduction to Machine Learning with Python - A GUIDE FOR DATA SCIENTISTS
by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller & Sarah Guido. I am fascintaed by the capabilities within python, I will become an expert in data manipulation, feature engineering, data 
extraction, machine learning, data visualization, and modeling. I am also currently building out my skills in Tableau through the Udemy course 'Tableau Certified 
Data Analyst Training' which contains 59 hours of material. I am also profficient at SQL.

I am currently purusing a 4 year degree in Economics with an emphasis on mathematics and quantitative economics. I see economics as a field of great opportunity 
and also vast enough to pursue different directions.

Also, if you are on X/Twitter and enjoy sports or basketball, feel free to give my passion project a follow or a like @SwishStatistics. I use as an outlet to scratch
my natural curiosity of numbers and Sports, as well as to grow my data skills. I have learned a lot about Python visiualizations, referecning APIs, as well as 
building out a very extensive relational MYSQL database. Hope you enjoy!!
