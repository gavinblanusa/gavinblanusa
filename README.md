Hello, I’m @gavinblanusa

I’m interested in data, statistics, economics, machine learning, and math. I use my passion for numbers to fuel my drive and curiosity for data and 
statistics within the fields of Finance, Economics, Sports, Health, and the Stock Market. I'm an Economics student at UT Dallas graduating in May 
2026 with a focus on Data Science.

I build things to figure out how the world works. Specifically, I'm interested in the intersection of technology, private markets, and AI. Currently, I'm an Analyst Intern at TRAC VC/AI. I spend my time researching the venture capital space and using open-source models like Ollama to algorithmically rank family offices. Before this, I was a Data Science Intern at Cruiter.AI. I helped analyze a 91-million-profile database using Python and built an AI-driven messaging system using LLM APIs to bump up response rates.

I learn best by building. I wanted a better way to analyze my own portfolio, so I built a personal investing application using Python and Cursor. It acts like a personal Bloomberg terminal with automated portfolio tracking and tax optimization. I've also built an AI workflow in AWS using Groq to track commodities trading data.

Feel free to reach me at my email gavinblanusa@comcast.net.
